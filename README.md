# Code Refactoring

Refactoring is a systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality that can transform a mess into clean code and simple design. The main purpose of refactoring is to fight technical debt. It transforms a mess into clean code and simple design.

## Introduction

The code aims to find bubble sort algorithm in python code and refactor it to quick sort algorithm. Time complexity of worst case scenario for bubble sort is O(n<sup>2</sup>) and for quick sort it is O(n log n). This means that quick sort is better than bubble sort. Hence we can refactor bubble sort to quick sort.
